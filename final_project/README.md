This Node.js Express project is an online bookshop API. It allows users to register, fetch a list of available books, get book details by ISBN, author, or title, and retrieve book reviews not only that but also have a authenticated bookshop API extension. It allows registered users to log in, add, update, and delete reviews for books. It uses JWT for authentication and session management.
